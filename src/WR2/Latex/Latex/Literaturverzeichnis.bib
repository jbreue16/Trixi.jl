abstract="We perform a linear and entropy stability analysis for wall boundary condition procedures for discontinuous Galerkin spectral element approximations of the compressible Euler equations. Two types of boundary procedures are examined. The first defines a special wall boundary flux that incorporates the boundary condition. The other is the commonly used reflection condition where an external state is specified that has an equal and opposite normal velocity. The internal and external states are then combined through an approximate Riemann solver to weakly impose the boundary condition. We show that with the exact upwind and Lax-Friedrichs solvers the approximations are energy dissipative, with the amount of dissipation proportional to the square of the normal Mach number. Standard approximate Riemann solvers, namely Lax-Friedrichs, HLL, HLLC are entropy stable. The Roe flux is entropy stable under certain conditions. An entropy conserving flux with an entropy stable dissipation term (EC-ES) is also presented. The analysis gives insight into why these boundary conditions are robust in that they introduce large amounts of energy or entropy dissipation when the boundary condition is not accurately satisfied, e.g. due to an impulsive start or under resolution.",

abstract = {In this work, we discuss two different but related aspects of the development of efficient discontinuous Galerkin methods on hybrid element grids for the computational modeling of gas dynamics in complex geometries or with adapted grids. In the first part, a recursive construction of different nodal sets for hp finite elements is presented. They share the property that the nodes along the sides of the two-dimensional elements and along the edges of the three-dimensional elements are the Legendre–Gauss–Lobatto points. The different nodal elements are evaluated by computing the Lebesgue constants of the corresponding Vandermonde matrix. In the second part, these nodal elements are applied within the modal discontinuous Galerkin framework. We still use a modal based formulation, but introduce a nodal based integration technique to reduce computational cost in the spirit of pseudospectral methods. We illustrate the performance of the scheme on several large scale applications and discuss its use in a recently developed space-time expansion discontinuous Galerkin scheme.}
